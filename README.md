# GPS-Example
A demo to show how pull requests work and how we could be using them for our benefit

  1. Create a feature branch and make your changes
  2. Instead of merging directly into the master or staging branch the developer creates a pull request
  3. What this does is more or less creating a request for the maintainer and every one else that you would like to merge this feature      into that branch.
  4. What that can be used for then are easy code reviews where anyone can go in and see your changes and comment if there are something that could be done in another way or anything else.
  5. You will also see if your changes will have any merge issues while merging.
  6. Not only will the commits become the history but also you can see the history with pull requests. Tracking features will become much easier than to go through all the commits which in any case might be incorrect anyway depending on how the merges are going or if anyone is performing a rebase.
